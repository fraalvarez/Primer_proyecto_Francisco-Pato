## Project Description
We decided to program a Battleship game as we considered it to be a project that would allow us to apply pretty much everything we've learned so far. It is a very interesting challenge that can be built in several ways.

<a name="workflow"></a>

## Workflow
Deciding the kind of project we wanted to work on.<\b>
Creating a list of the different parts of the game that we needed to consider.<\b>
Making a high level description of the process and how everything should work together.<\b>
Splitting tasks into separate simpler methods/classes.<\b>
Deciding on data structures to be used and how to work with them.<\b>
Programming and testing of the individual modules separately.<\b>
Documentation.<\b>
Creation of main process that would take the necessary actions to perform all the required actions.<\b>
Full stack testing.

## Organization
We began by splitting the project into the separate parts that we needed to program and keep in mind throughout the development. After that we developed a plan on who was going to tackle the different tasks at hand.<\b>
We first created methods to receive input from the user to set the positions on the Battleship board of our boats. The next issue was how to print the boards, which we tackled in two separate ways.<\b>
This was the moment we began to split the project into a separate classful and a classless version, in which we did separate codes that ended up being the prototypes we present in this repository.
